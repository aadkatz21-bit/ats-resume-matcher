      <h3>1. How to Use the ATS Resume Matcher</h3>
      <p>
        Navigate to the Tool page and paste your resume text into the first box and the job description
        into the second box. Click <strong>Compare</strong> to see your match score and a list of
        keywords that are present in the job description but missing from your resume. Use this
        information to update your resume before submitting your application.

      <h3>2. Why Missing Keywords Matter</h3>
      <p>
        Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) scan resumes for specific terms related to the job. If your
        resume lacks important keywords or skills, it may be filtered out before a human ever sees it.
        Including relevant keywords ensures your resume passes the initial screening.

      <h3>3. Why ATS Optimization is Important</h3>
      <p>
        With more than 97% of large companies using ATS software and 75% of resumes never reaching
        recruiters, optimizing your resume has become essential. Proper optimization
        gives you a better chance of being selected for an interview by ensuring your resume ranks well
        against the job description.

      <h3>4. Resume Structure Do’s & Don’ts</h3>
      <p>
        Keep your resume format simple: use standard section headings, avoid graphics or tables that
        might confuse ATS parsing algorithms, and maintain consistent date formats. A clear, linear
        structure makes it easier for ATS to extract relevant information.
