    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we
      collect when you use the ATS Resume Matcher (“the service”) and how we use and protect
      it. By using our service, you consent to the practices described here.
    </p>
    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and a password. We store this information securely using Firebase Authentication.</li>
      <li><strong>Resume & Job Data:</strong> If you paste your resume and job description to run a match, those texts are processed in your browser and are not uploaded to our servers. If you choose to save a resume to your profile, we store it in our database so you can reuse it later.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> With your consent, we may collect anonymized analytics (e.g. page visits, session length) through Google Analytics to improve our service.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How We Use Your Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the service, including authenticating users and enabling resume matching.</li>
      <li>To respond to your inquiries or support requests.</li>
      <li>To improve the functionality and user experience of the service by analyzing anonymized usage data.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cookies & Tracking</h3>
    <p>
      We use cookies to remember your preferences (such as cookie consent) and, with your
      permission, to run analytics. You can accept or decline cookies via the cookie banner.
      If you decline, no analytics cookies will be set.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Sharing & Third Parties</h3>
    <p>
      We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties except as required to provide
      our services (e.g. Firebase for authentication and database). These service providers act
      as data processors and are contractually obligated to protect your data. We may also disclose
      information if required by law or to protect our rights.
    </p>
    <h3>Your Rights</h3>
    <p>
      Under GDPR and similar laws, you have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data.
      You can log in to your account to manage your information or contact us at
      <a href="mailto:support@example.com">support@example.com</a> to request data deletion. If you
      are a California resident, you also have the right to know what personal data we collect,
      request deletion of your data, and opt out of the sale of personal information (we do not sell
      personal data).
    </p>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>
      We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including encryption at rest
      and in transit where applicable. However, no system is completely secure; please use a strong
      password and protect your account credentials.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the
      updated policy on this page with the revision date. We encourage you to review this page
      periodically.
